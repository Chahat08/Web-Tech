    <h1 style="text-align: center;"><u>The Hobbit</u></h1>
    <h2 style="text-align:center;"><u>by J.R.R. Tolkein</u></h2>
    <br />
    <p>A book full of adventure, heroism, song and laughter, featuring landscapes that are <i><b>quintessentially</i></b> English - the Shire the Hobbits inhabit could easily be an England of yesteryear. But soon the Shire is left behind and Bilbo, our <i><b>reluctant</i></b> hero, encounters Dwarves, Elves, Goblins, Eagles and Wizards as the party passes through Rivendell, The <i><b>Misty</i></b> Mountains and Mirkwood on their way to the <i><b>Lonely</i></b> Mountain, in order to take back treasure stolen by the <i><b>great</i></b> dragon Smaug.</p>
